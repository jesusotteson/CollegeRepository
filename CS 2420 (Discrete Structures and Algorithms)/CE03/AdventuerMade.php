        and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful. They
        have keen eyesight and hearing. Elves are typically
        inquisitive, passionate, self-assured, and sometimes
        haughty. Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or

        a secret door with a cursory look. Elves are immune to
        the paralyzing attack of ghouls. Also, they are less likely to
        be surprised in combat, reducing the chance of surprise by
        1 in 1d6.</p>

        Initiative die rolls. Outdoors in their preferred forest
        terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as
        they remain still there is only a 10% chance they will be
        detected. Even indoors, in dungeons or in non-preferred
        terrain they are able to hide such that there is only a 30%
