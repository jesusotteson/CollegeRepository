You know you have to get to New York, but you don't know why.
You have 24 hours to find out who set you up.
There is a large black device in front of you, ticking ominously.
Someone has been following you for days, but you do not know who.
In one week, a major volcano is going to blow.
You are lost in a see of fog.
